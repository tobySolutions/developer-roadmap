# DockerHub

Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service that serves as the primary public repository for Docker container images. It allows users to store, share, and distribute Docker images, offering both free public repositories and paid private ones and integrates seamlessly with Docker CLI, enabling easy pushing and pulling of images. It features official images maintained by software vendors, automated builds linked to source code repositories, and webhooks for triggering actions based on repository events.
