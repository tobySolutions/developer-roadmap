# Image Tagging Best Practices

Docker image tagging best practices center on creating clear, consistent, and informative labels. Adopt semantic versioning for releases, avoid the ambiguous "latest" tag in production, and include relevant metadata like build dates or Git commit hashes. Implement a strategy distinguishing between environments, use descriptive tags for variants, and automate tagging in CI/CD pipelines. Regularly clean up old tags and document your conventions to maintain clarity and facilitate team-wide adoption. These practices ensure efficient image management and improve collaboration across your organization.
