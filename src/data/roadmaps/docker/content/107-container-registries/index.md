# Container Registries

A Container Registry is a centralized storage and distribution system for Docker container images. It allows developers to easily share and deploy applications in the form of these images. Container registries play a crucial role in the deployment of containerized applications, as they provide a fast, reliable, and secure way to distribute container images across various production environments.
