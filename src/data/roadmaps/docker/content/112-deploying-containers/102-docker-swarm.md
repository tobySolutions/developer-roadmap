# Docker Swarm

Docker Swarm is Dockerâ€™s native container orchestration tool that allows users to deploy, manage, and scale containers across a cluster of Docker hosts. By transforming a group of Docker nodes into a single, unified cluster, Swarm provides high availability, load balancing, and automated container scheduling using simple declarative commands. With features like service discovery, rolling updates, and integrated security through TLS encryption, Docker Swarm offers an approachable alternative to more complex orchestrators like Kubernetes. Its tight integration with the Docker CLI and ease of setup make it a suitable choice for small to medium-sized deployments where simplicity and straightforward management are priorities.
