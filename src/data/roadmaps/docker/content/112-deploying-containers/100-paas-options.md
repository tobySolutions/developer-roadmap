# PaaS Options for Deploying Containers

Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) options for deploying containers provide a simplified and managed environment where developers can build, deploy, and scale containerized applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Popular PaaS offerings include Google Cloud Run, Azure App Service, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and Heroku, which abstract away container orchestration complexities while offering automated scaling, easy integration with CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring capabilities. These platforms support rapid development and deployment by allowing teams to focus on application logic rather than server management, providing a seamless way to run containers in production with minimal operational overhead.
