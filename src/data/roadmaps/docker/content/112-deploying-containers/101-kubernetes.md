# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a robust framework for handling complex container workloads by organizing containers into logical units called pods, managing service discovery, load balancing, and scaling through declarative configurations. Kubernetes enables teams to deploy containers across clusters of machines, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance through self-healing capabilities like automatic restarts, replacements, and rollback mechanisms. With its extensive ecosystem and flexibility, Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for running large-scale, distributed applications, simplifying operations and improving the reliability of containerized workloads.
