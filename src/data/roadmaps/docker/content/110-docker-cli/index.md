# Docker CLI

The Docker Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool used to interact with the Docker engine, enabling developers and operators to build, manage, and troubleshoot containers and related resources. With a wide range of commands, the Docker CLI provides control over all aspects of Docker, including creating and managing containers (`docker run`, `docker stop`), building images (`docker build`), managing networks (`docker network`), handling storage (`docker volume`), and inspecting system status (`docker ps`, `docker info`). Its intuitive syntax and flexibility allow users to automate complex workflows, streamline development processes, and maintain containerized applications with ease, making it a foundational utility for Docker management and orchestration.
