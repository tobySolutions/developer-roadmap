# Runtime Configuration Options

Docker runtime configuration options give you powerful control over your containers' environments. By tweaking resource limits, network settings, security profiles, and logging drivers, you can optimize performance and enhance security. You'll also find options for setting environment variables, mounting volumes, and overriding default behaviors â€“ all crucial for tailoring containers to your specific needs. For more advanced users, there are tools to adjust kernel capabilities and set restart policies. Whether you're using command-line flags or Docker Compose files, these options help ensure your containers run smoothly and consistently, no matter where they're deployed.
