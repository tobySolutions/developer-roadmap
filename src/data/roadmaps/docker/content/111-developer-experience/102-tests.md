# Tests

We want to run tests in an environment as similar as possible to production, so it only makes sense to do so inside of our containers! This can include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, all run within Docker containers to simulate real-world scenarios while avoiding interference from external dependencies. Using Docker CLI and tools like Docker Compose, you can create isolated testing environments, run tests in parallel, and spin up and tear down the necessary infrastructure automatically.
