# Container Security

Container security encompasses a broad set of practices and tools aimed at protecting containerized applications from development through deployment and runtime. It involves securing the container image, ensuring that only trusted and non-vulnerable code is used, implementing strong access controls for container environments, and configuring containers to follow the principle of least privilege. Additionally, it includes monitoring for unexpected behavior, protecting communication between containers, and maintaining the host environmentâ€™s security. Effective container security integrates seamlessly into DevSecOps workflows to provide continuous visibility and protection across the container lifecycle without disrupting development speed or agility.
