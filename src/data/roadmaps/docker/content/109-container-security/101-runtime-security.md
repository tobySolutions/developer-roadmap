# Runtime Security

Runtime security in Docker focuses on ensuring the safety and integrity of containers during their execution, safeguarding against vulnerabilities and malicious activities that could arise while the containerized application is running. This involves monitoring container behavior for anomalies, implementing access controls to limit permissions, and employing tools to detect and respond to suspicious activity in real time. Effective runtime security also ensures that only verified images are deployed and continuously audits the system to maintain compliance, thereby providing a robust defense layer to prevent exploits and maintain the desired security posture throughout the container lifecycle.
