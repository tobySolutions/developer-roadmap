# Linear Search

Linear search is one of the simplest search algorithms. In this method, every element in an array is checked sequentially starting from the first until a match is found or all elements have been checked. It is also known as sequential search. It works on both sorted and unsorted lists, and does not need any preconditioned list for the operation. However, its efficiency is lesser as compared to other search algorithms since it checks all elements one by one.
