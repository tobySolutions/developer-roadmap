# Packages

Packages are the most powerful part of the Go language. The purpose of a package is to design and maintain a large number of programs by grouping related features together into single units so that they can be easy to maintain and understand and independent of the other package programs. This modularity allows them to share and reuse. In Go language, every package is defined with a different name and that name is close to their functionality like “strings” package and it contains methods and functions that only related to strings.
