# Memory Management

Memory management in Redis involves efficiently handling data storage within its in-memory structure to maximize performance and prevent memory overflows. Redis uses various techniques such as memory-efficient data encoding (e.g., `ziplist` or `intset`), active and passive eviction strategies based on the configured max memory policy, and expiration of keys to automatically free up space. To persist data, Redis offers snapshotting (RDB) and logging (AOF) mechanisms. Additionally, commands like `MEMORY USAGE` and `MEMORY STATS` help monitor memory consumption, making it easier to tune and optimize the instance for specific use cases. Effective memory management ensures high availability, low latency, and predictable performance.
