# INCR

`INCR` is a Redis command used to increment the value of a string key by 1. If the key does not exist, it initializes the key with a value of 0 before performing the increment operation, resulting in a value of 1. If the key contains a non-integer value, the command will return an error. `INCR` is atomic, meaning it is safe to use in concurrent environments without race conditions, making it ideal for use cases like counters or tracking metrics.
