# LPUSH

`LPUSH` is a Redis command that inserts one or more elements at the beginning (left side) of a list. If the list does not exist, it creates a new list before performing the insertion. This command returns the length of the list after the operation. `LPUSH` is useful for building stacks or adding items to queues where new elements need to be prioritized, enabling efficient manipulation of ordered data structures in Redis.
