# redis.conf

`redis.conf` is the configuration file used by Redis to set up server parameters and customize its behavior. This file allows administrators to specify various settings, including memory limits, persistence options (like RDB and AOF), network configurations (such as port and binding addresses), and security features (like password protection and access control). Key parameters within `redis.conf` include `maxmemory`, which sets the maximum amount of memory Redis can use, `save`, which defines RDB snapshot intervals, and `requirepass`, which enables password authentication for client connections.
