# Redis vs SQL/NoSQL DBs

Redis differs significantly from traditional SQL and NoSQL databases in terms of data model, performance, and use cases. Redis is an in-memory key-value store that supports various data structures like strings, hashes, lists, and sets, allowing for flexible data handling and low-latency access. This makes it ideal for high-speed operations such as caching, real-time analytics, and session management. In contrast, SQL databases use a structured schema with tables and relationships, excelling in complex queries and transactions, while other NoSQL databases may utilize document, graph, or wide-column models to accommodate unstructured or semi-structured data.
