# More Commands - Sorted Sets

Redis Sorted Sets include operations like ZREVRANGE to get elements in reverse order, ZRANGEBYLEX to retrieve elements within a specific lexicographical range, and ZINTERSTORE or ZUNIONSTORE to perform intersection and union operations on multiple sorted sets and store the results. Commands like ZREMrangeBYRANK and ZREMRANGEBYSCORE allow for removing elements based on their rank or score ranges.
