# More Commands - Streams

Streams include a variety of operations that enhance the core functionality provided by basic commands like XADD and XREAD. Examples include XDEL to remove specific entries from a stream, XTRIM to control the size of a stream by trimming old entries, and XGROUP for managing consumer groups, allowing multiple clients to read from the same stream in a coordinated manner. Commands like XPENDING and XCLAIM are useful for monitoring and handling pending messages, ensuring that no data is lost or left unprocessed.
