# How RDB Works?

The RDB (Redis Database Backup) mechanism in Redis creates snapshots of the dataset at specified intervals and saves them to disk as a compact binary file. This process is triggered manually, via the `SAVE` or `BGSAVE` commands, or automatically based on predefined conditions. During a snapshot, Redis forks a child process to write the in-memory data to the RDB file, ensuring that the main process is not blocked. While RDB offers a lightweight and fast backup option, it may lead to potential data loss if Redis crashes between snapshots, making it ideal for periodic backups rather than real-time persistence.
