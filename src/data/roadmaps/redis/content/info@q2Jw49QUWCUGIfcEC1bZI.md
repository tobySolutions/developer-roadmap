# INFO

`INFO` is a Redis command that provides detailed information and statistics about the server, including memory usage, CPU load, connected clients, replication status, and more. It can be called without arguments to get a full overview or with specific sections (e.g., `INFO memory`) to retrieve targeted data. This command is useful for monitoring and debugging Redis instances, helping administrators understand the server's current state and performance metrics.
