# Naming Conventions

Naming conventions in Redis are crucial for maintaining organized and understandable data structures, especially in large applications. Common practices include using colons (`:`) as separators for hierarchical keys (e.g., `user:1001:settings`), employing prefixes to group related keys (e.g., `session:`, `cache:`), and using concise, descriptive names to indicate the purpose and type of the key.
