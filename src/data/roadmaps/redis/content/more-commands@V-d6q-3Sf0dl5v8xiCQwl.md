# More Commands - Pub/Sub

Redis Pub/Sub include operations like PSUBSCRIBE and PUNSUBSCRIBE for subscribing and unsubscribing to channels using pattern matching, allowing for flexible topic-based subscriptions. Additionally, PUBSUB CHANNELS lists active channels, PUBSUB NUMSUB shows the number of subscribers per channel, and PUBSUB NUMPAT returns the count of active pattern subscriptions. These commands extend the basic publish and subscribe functionality, providing better insights and control over the messaging patterns, making Pub/Sub ideal for real-time event broadcasting, chat applications, and inter-service communication in distributed systems.
