# Replication Basics

Replication in Redis is a process that allows data from one Redis instance (the master) to be copied to one or more Redis instances (the replicas). This mechanism enhances data availability, reliability, and scalability. When a master instance receives write operations, it propagates these changes to its replicas, ensuring they maintain an up-to-date copy of the data. Replication in Redis is asynchronous, meaning that replicas may lag behind the master, but this design improves performance by allowing the master to handle write operations without waiting for replicas to confirm the receipt of data. In addition to providing redundancy, Redis replication supports read scaling, as read operations can be distributed across replicas, reducing the load on the master. Configuring replication is straightforward, requiring minimal setup in the `redis.conf` file to designate a master and its replicas. Overall, replication is a fundamental feature in Redis that plays a crucial role in building resilient and scalable applications.
