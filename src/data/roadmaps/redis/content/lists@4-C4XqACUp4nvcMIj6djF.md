# Lists

Lists in Redis are ordered collections of string elements, allowing operations such as pushing, popping, and accessing elements by index. Lists support various commands, like `LPUSH` and `RPUSH` to add elements to the beginning or end, `LPOP` and `RPOP` to remove elements, and `LRANGE` to retrieve a range of elements. They are ideal for use cases like message queues, task management, or implementing stacks and queues, where maintaining order is crucial. Lists can grow dynamically and provide high performance for operations at the ends, making them highly flexible for managing ordered data sequences.
