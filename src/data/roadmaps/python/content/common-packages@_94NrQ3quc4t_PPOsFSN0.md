# Common Packages and Modules

Python has a rich ecosystem of packages and modules that can be used to get the most out of the language. A package is essentially a directory that contains multiple modules and subpackages. A module is a single file that contains a collection of related functions, classes, and variables. Modules are the basic building blocks of Python code organization. A module can be thought of as a container that holds a set of related code.
