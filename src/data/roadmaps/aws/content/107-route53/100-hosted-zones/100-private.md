# Private

Private Hosted Zones in AWS are DNS name spaces that exist within one or more Amazon VPCs. You can use private hosted zones to route traffic within your VPCs. The domain and subdomains in a private hosted zone are not resolvable over the internet but only in your VPCs. You can use this feature to have internal domain names such as "internal.example.com" resolved to private IP addresses on your Amazon VPC backends.
