# Component Life Cycle

React components have a lifecycle consisting of three phases: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting along with several “lifecycle methods” that you can override to run code at particular times in the process.

It is not recommended to use lifecycle methods manually. Instead, use the useEffect hook with functional components.
