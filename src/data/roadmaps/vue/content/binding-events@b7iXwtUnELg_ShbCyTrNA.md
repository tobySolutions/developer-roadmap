# Binding Events

Vue.js is an open-source Model–View–ViewModel front-end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. Vue.js has many own directives for DOM manipulation such as v-bind, v-on, v-model, etc. Binding events is an essential part of creating interactive applications. You can bind events using the v-on directive or its shorthand, the @ symbol.
