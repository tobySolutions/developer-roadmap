# Hugging Face Tasks

Hugging Face supports text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, summarization, and translation. It also extends to multimodal tasks that involve both text and images, such as visual question answering (VQA) and image-text matching. Each task is done by various pre-trained models that can be easily accessed and fine-tuned through the Hugging Face library.
