# Know your Customers / Usecases

To know your customer means deeply understanding the needs, behaviors, and expectations of your target users. This ensures the tools you create are tailored precisely for their intended purpose, while also being designed to prevent misuse or unintended applications. By clearly defining the tool’s functionality and boundaries, you can align its features with the users’ goals while incorporating safeguards that limit its use in contexts it wasn’t designed for. This approach enhances both the tool’s effectiveness and safety, reducing the risk of improper use.
