# Video Understanding

Video understanding with multimodal AI involves analyzing and interpreting both visual and audio content to provide a more comprehensive understanding of videos. Common use cases include video summarization, where AI extracts key scenes and generates summaries; content moderation, where the system detects inappropriate visuals or audio; and video indexing for easier search and retrieval of specific moments within a video. Other applications include enhancing video-based recommendations, security surveillance, and interactive entertainment, where video and audio are processed together for real-time user interaction.
