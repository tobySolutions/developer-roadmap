# Pricing Considerations

The pricing for the OpenAI Embedding API is based on the number of tokens processed and the specific embedding model used. Costs are determined by the total tokens needed to generate embeddings, so longer texts will result in higher charges. To manage costs, developers can optimize by shortening inputs or batching requests. Additionally, selecting the right embedding model for your performance and budget requirements, along with monitoring token usage, can help control expenses.
