## Is DevOps engineer career path right for you?

DevOps is a field that's here to stay. The DevOps market grew to an incredible $10.3 billion at the end of 2023 and it is growing. Hence, securing a DevOps role is your first step toward a long-lasting career.

DevOps career paths are worth considering if you have experience in software development, networking, or operations. It involves automation, testing, monitoring, configuring, networking, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and requires a diverse skill set as discussed below. It is a bridge between development and operations teams.

These are some factors to consider before choosing the DevOps engineer career path:

- Interest in automation
- Enjoy collaborating
- Interest in infrastructure management
- Love for problem-solving
- Willingness to continuously learn new skills and technology

### Interest in automation

Automation is an integral part of the DevOps career path. It involves writing scripts and code to automate repetitive tasks and enhance software delivery processes.  By automating repetitive tasks and workflows, DevOps teams can increase efficiency, reduce errors, and accelerate time to market for software releases.

### Enjoy collaborating

Collaboration is crucial in the DevOps career, as you will work with different people across several teams. The goal is to break down the silos across teams and ensure they all work together to achieve the same goal. Having great collaboration skills is crucial to being a DevOps engineer.

### Interest in infrastructure management

Do you enjoy working on infrastructural rather than domain code? The plus side of infrastructural code is that it can be replicated across several infrastructures once it is set up, and you can transfer the knowledge to other organizations instead of domain code, where you would always need to learn the domain of the business you are writing code for.

### Love for problem-solving

Choosing this field requires that you enjoy solving problems and can devise solutions to complex problems.

### Willingness to continuously learn new skills and technology

DevOps is an evolving field, and there is always something new. To be up to date, you have to be willing and open to continuous learning. This involves taking courses, reading articles, and getting updates on things happening in the DevOps field and tech.

It is worth noting that working in DevOps involves working in high-pressure environments. You are constantly relied on to manage an organization's IT and new and existing cloud systems, which can sometimes be overwhelming.

Also, there is a steep learning curve. As a tech beginner, it could be daunting and challenging to get into DevOps and adapt the DevOps culture, but as you go along, it gets easier.

## DevOps in 2024

According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1367003/in-demand-it-roles/), DevOps software engineering positions are among the top technical positions demanded by recruiters worldwide in 2023. Indeed reported that the average annual salary of [DevOps engineer](https://www.indeed.com/career/development-operations-engineer/salaries?from=top_sb) in the USA is $124,392.

DevOps has evolved over the last decade. Today, it is more than automating tasks and having engineers write scripts. It is now more about practices that can help to automate software delivery, improve business and the overall software development processes.

Certain trends are impacting the DevOps market currently and will also play a role in the future of DevOps. Some of them include:

- Microservices
- Cloud technology
- Automation and CI/CD
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Let's look at these trends and how they indirectly influence your decision.

### Microservices

This architecture enables the agile development and continuous delivery of software solutions. In a microservice architecture, applications are split into smaller parts known as microservices that focus on a single responsibility. Each part (microservice) is developed and deployed independently, and microservices communicate via events or API interfaces.

It is a common trend, and many organizations are adopting this architecture because of its benefits, one of which is adapting to market changes and shipping out features faster rather than the delays of modular monoliths. A DevOps engineer is critical to helping in the adoption and success of microservices.

### Cloud technology

Cloud-native applications have become popular recently. They involve developing and deploying software applications and their dependencies in a cloud environment.

There are several cloud platforms, some of the most popular ones being [AWS](https://roadmap.sh/aws), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). One advantage of using these cloud providers is that you don't have to manage the cloud infrastructure but instead focus on developing your applications. You also pay for only the resources you use.

Containerization tools like [Docker](https://roadmap.sh/docker) and [Kubernetes](https://roadmap.sh/kubernetes) have been made popular by cloud services and microservices. These tools are part of the toolkit of DevOps engineers.

### Automation and CI/CD

Automation and continuous integration/continuous deployment are integral to DevOps. Organizations are widely adopting automation of their infrastructure and deployments because of its benefits including faster and more reliable application deployments.

Also, with the adoption of GitOps, an operational framework that takes DevOps principles and best practices for application development and applies them to infrastructure automation, the deployment process is even more efficient. DevOps professionals are the major catalysts for this and will remain relevant.

### Artificial intelligence and machine learning

AI and ML have become integrated into our daily lives and automation tools are used to automate processes and routine tasks, monitor system health, and predict potential system issues. These AI tools need to be designed, maintained, and enhanced.

In the AI and ML field, it is the job of an MLOps engineer, but a DevOps engineer can upskill and switch roles to an MLOps engineer.

There is a concern that AI will replace DevOps professionals. However, I believe AI will complement the DevOps process, improve the software development lifecycle, and make better DevOps engineers.

## Specializations in DevOps

The DevOps career paths are rewarding and successful. The DevOps career also offers a lot of growth opportunities, and as you have seen in the previous section, it is in high demand.
