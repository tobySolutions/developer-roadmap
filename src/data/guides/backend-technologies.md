![APIs and Web Services](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/rest-vs-graphql-vs-grpc-tp40c.png)

APIs (or Application Programming Interfaces) and web services are another mandatory incorporation to the list of top backend technologies any developer should keep in mind. They enable communication between different software systems.

The three most common types of APIs right now, are REST, GraphQL and gPRC, let’s take a closer look at each one of them.

### REST

REST is a standard architecture for web services, known for its simplicity and scalability. It operates on stateless principles and uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. RESTful APIs are typically used to access and manipulate web resources using URLs.

REST is ideal for web applications and services due to its ease of implementation and broad compatibility with various web technologies. It is commonly used for developing APIs for web and mobile applications, providing endpoints that clients can interact with to perform various operations. RESTful APIs are also ideal for integrating with third-party services, enabling data exchange and interaction between different systems.

#### Key Characteristics of REST

**Statelessness**: Each request from a client contains all the information needed to process the request, without relying on stored context on the server.

**Uniform Interface**: REST APIs follow standard conventions, making them easy to understand and use. This includes using standard HTTP methods and status codes.

**Client-Server Architecture**: Separates the client and server concerns, improving scalability and flexibility. Clients handle the user interface and user experience, while servers handle data storage and business logic.

**Cacheability**: Responses from REST APIs can be cached to improve performance, reducing the need for repeated requests.

**Layered System**: REST allows for a layered system architecture, enabling intermediaries like load balancers and proxy servers to enhance security, performance, and scalability.

If you’d like to know more about REST, you can read the full definition directly from [its source here](https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm).

### GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data. Unlike REST, where multiple endpoints return fixed data structures, GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need. This flexibility reduces the amount of data transferred over the network and can significantly improve performance.

GraphQL is ideal for applications with complex and dynamic data requirements.

#### Key Characteristics of GraphQL

**Declarative Data Fetching**: Clients specify the structure of the response, ensuring they receive only the data they need.

**Strongly Typed Schema**: The API schema is strongly typed, providing clear and detailed documentation of available data and operations.

**Single Endpoint**: Unlike REST, GraphQL uses a single endpoint to serve all requests, simplifying the API architecture.

**Real-time Data**: Supports real-time updates through subscriptions, enabling clients to receive live data changes.

### gRPC

gRPC is a high-performance, open-source RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework developed by Google. gRPC is designed for low-latency, high-throughput communication, making it suitable for microservices architectures and real-time communication systems.

gRPC is ideal for applications that require efficient, reliable, and bi-directional communication.
