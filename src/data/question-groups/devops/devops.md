![Popular DevOps interview questions and answers.](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/devops-interview-questions-x6n2w.jpg)

The evolution of technology and practices, coupled with the increase in complexity of the systems we develop, make the role of DevOps more relevant by the day.

But becoming a successful DevOps is not a trivial task, especially because this role is usually the evolution of a developer looking to get more involved in other related ops areas or someone from ops who’s starting to get more directly involved in the development space. 

Either way, DevOps engineers live between the development and operations teams, understanding enough about each area to be able to work towards improving their interactions.

Because of this strange situation, while detailed roadmaps (be sure to check out our DevOps roadmap!) help a lot, getting ready for a DevOps interview requires a lot of work.

Here are the most relevant DevOps interview questions you’ll likely get asked during a DevOps interview, plus a few more that will push your skills to the next level.

## Preparing for your DevOps interview

Before diving into your DevOps technical interview, keep these key points in mind:

1.  **Understand the core concepts**: Familiarize yourself with the essentials of DevOps practices, including continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), infrastructure as code (IaC), the software development lifecycle, and containerization. Understand how these concepts contribute to the overall development lifecycle.
2. **Practice hands-on skills**: There is a lot of practical knowledge involved in the DevOps practice, so make sure you try what you read about. Set up some CI/CD pipelines for your pet projects, understand containerization, and pick a tool to get started. The more you practice, the more prepared you’ll be for real-world problems.
3. **Study software architecture**: While you may not have the responsibilities of an architect, having a solid understanding of software architecture principles can be a huge help. Being able to discuss the different components of a system with architects would make you a huge asset to any team.
4. **Research the Company**: In general, it’s always a great idea to research the company you’re interviewing for. In this case, investigate the company’s DevOps practices, the technologies they use, and their overall approach to software development. This will help you demonstrate a genuine interest in their operations and come prepared with thoughtful questions.

With that out of the way, let’s move on to the specific DevOps interview questions to prepare for.
