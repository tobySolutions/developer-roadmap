Goal of this project is to write a script to analyse server performance stats.

## Requirements

You are required to write a script `server-stats.sh` that can analyse basic server performance stats. You should be able to run the script on any Linux server and it should give you the following stats:

- Total CPU usage
- Total memory usage (Free vs Used including percentage)
- Total disk usage (Free vs Used including percentage)
- Top 5 processes by CPU usage
- Top 5 processes by memory usage

Stretch goal: Feel free to optionally add more stats such as os version, uptime, load average, logged in users, failed login attempts etc.

<hr />

Once you have completed this project, you will have some basic knowledge on how to analyse server performance stats in order to debug and get a better understanding of the server's performance.
