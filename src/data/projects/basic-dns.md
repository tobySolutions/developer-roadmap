The goal of this project is to learn and practice the basics of DNS. You are required to purchase a custom domain name and setup the basic DNS records.

## Requirements

You are required to have a custom domain name to complete this project. You can use the domain name you already own or purchase a new domain name from any provider such as Cloudflare, Namecheap, Godaddy etc. Once you have a domain name, you can proceed to the next step.

### Task #1 - Custom Domain for GitHub Pages

If you have not completed the [GitHub pages project](/projects/github-actions-deployment-workflow), go ahead and complete that project first. Once you have a github pages site setup, set up your custom domain name to point to your github pages site.

### Task #2 - Custom Domain for DigitalOcean Droplet

If you have not completed the [Static Site Server project](/projects/static-site-server), go ahead and complete that project first so you have a basic static site to serve. Once you have a digital ocean droplet setup serving a static site, set up your DNS records to point to your droplet.
