The goal of this project is to introduce you to the basics of configuration management using Ansible. You will write an Ansible playbook to configure a Linux server.

## Requirements

If you have been doing the previous projects, you should already have a Linux server running. If not, setup a Linux server on [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/b29aa8845df8), AWS or another cloud provider.

You are required to write an Ansible playbook called `setup.yml` and create the following roles:

- `base` — basic server setup (installs utilities, updates the server, installs `fail2ban`, etc.)
- `nginx` — installs and configures `nginx`
- `app` — uploads the given tarball of a static HTML website to the server and unzips it.
- `ssh` - adds the given public key to the server

Set up the inventory file `inventory.ini` to include the server you are going to configure When you run the playbook, it should run the roles above in sequence. You should also assign proper tags to the roles so that you can run only specific roles.

Example:

```bash
# Run all the roles
ansible-playbook setup.yml

# Run only the app role
ansible-playbook setup.yml --tags "app"
```

### Stretch goal

Modify the `app` role to pull the repository from GitHub and deploy it.

Once you are done with the project, you should have a basic understanding of how Ansible works and how it can be used to manage server configuration.
