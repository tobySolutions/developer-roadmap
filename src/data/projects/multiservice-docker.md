The goal of this project is to help you practice a more advanced docker setup involving multiple services, volumes, networks, custom base images, multi-stage builds, secrets and more. The project will simulate a real-world scenario with multiple interconnected services, each with its own build requirements and optimizations.

## Requirements

Create a multi-service application using Docker that consists of the following components:

- **Web Application**: A basic react-based frontend application.
- **API Service**: A Node.js Express backend API.
- **Database**: A MongoDB instance for storing application data.
- **Cache**: A Redis cache for improving performance.
- **Reverse Proxy**: An Nginx reverse proxy to handle incoming requests.

Implement the following Docker features and best practices:

- Use Docker Compose to define and run the multi-container application.
- Create custom base images for the web application and API service.
- Implement multi-stage builds for the web application to optimize the final image size.
- Set up a Docker network to allow communication between services.
- Use Docker volumes for persistent data storage (database and cache).
- Implement Docker secrets for sensitive information (e.g., database passwords).
- Configure health checks for each service.
- Optimize Dockerfiles for each service to reduce image sizes and improve build times.
- Implement logging and log rotation for all services.

By completing this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with advanced Docker concepts and best practices in a realistic, multi-service environment. This will prepare you for working with complex containerized applications in production scenarios.
