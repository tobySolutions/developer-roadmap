This project involves creating a backend system for an image processing service similar to Cloudinary. The service will allow users to upload images, perform various transformations, and retrieve images in different formats. The system will feature user authentication, image upload, transformation operations, and efficient retrieval mechanisms.

## Requirements

Here is the list of features that you should implement in this project:

### User Authentication

- **Sign-Up**: Allow users to create an account.
- **Log-In**: Allow users to log into their account.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure endpoints using JWTs for authenticated access.

### Image Management

- **Upload Image**: Allow users to upload images.
- **Transform Image**: Allow users to perform various transformations (resize, crop, rotate, watermark etc.).
- **Retrieve Image**: Allow users to retrieve a saved image in different formats.
- **List Images**: List all uploaded images by the user with metadata.

### Image Transformation

Here is the list of transformations that you can implement:

- Resize
- Crop
- Rotate
- Watermark
- Flip
- Mirror
- Compress
- Change format (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
- Apply filters (grayscale, sepia, etc.)

Feel free to add more transformations based on your interest and expertise.

## How to Implement

Here is the list of endpoints that you can implement for this project:

### Authentication Endpoints

Register a new user:

```
POST /register
{
  "username": "user1",
  "password": "password123"
}
```
Response should be the user object with a JWT.

Log in an existing user:

```
POST /login
{
  "username": "user1",
  "password": "password123"
}
```
Response should be the user object with a JWT.

### Image Management Endpoints

#### Upload an image:

```
POST /images
Request Body: Multipart form-data with image file
Response: Uploaded image details (URL, metadata).
```

#### Apply transformations to an image:

```
POST /images/:id/transform
{
  "transformations": {
    "resize": {
      "width": "number",
      "height": "number"
    },
    "crop": {
      "width": "number",
      "height": "number",
      "x": "number",
      "y": "number"
    },
    "rotate": "number",
    "format": "string",
    "filters": {
      "grayscale": "boolean",
      "sepia": "boolean"
    }
  }
}
```
User can apply one or more transformations to the image. Response should be the transformed image details (URL, metadata).

#### Retrieve an image:

```
GET /images/:id
```
Response should be the image actual image detail.

#### Get a paginated list of images:

```
GET /images?page=1&limit=10
```

## Tips

- Use a cloud storage service like AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, or Google Cloud Storage to store images.
- Use some image processing libraries to apply transformations.
- Put a rate limit on image transformations to prevent abuse.
- Consider caching transformed images to improve performance.
- Implement error handling and validation for all endpoints.
- Optionally use a message queue like RabbitMQ or Kafka to process image transformations asynchronously.

<hr />

This project will help you understand how to build a scalable image processing service with user authentication and image transformation capabilities. You can use this project to showcase your backend development skills and learn about image processing techniques.
